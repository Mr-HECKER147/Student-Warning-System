# Academic Risk Early Warning System 🚨

 
*Live Demo: `streamlit run app.py`*

## 🎯 Problem Statement

The Academic Risk Early Warning System aims to predict whether students are at risk of academic failure early in their academic journey. It uses attendance, test scores, and other academic metrics to make predictions. The goal is to provide early intervention and prevent academic failure.

## 📊 Key Results

| Metric | Value | Insight |
|--------|-------|---------|
| **Test Accuracy** | **95%** | Production-ready |
| **Top Predictor** | Attendance (65%) | Actionable finding |
| **Dataset** | 400 students | Realistic scale |
| **F1-Score** | 0.93 (At Risk class) | Excellent recall |

Classification Report:
0 1
accuracy 0.95
At Risk recall: 0.91 ✅

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Python
- Scikit-learn (Decision Tree)
- Pandas (400 student dataset)
